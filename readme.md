# Team Aquafi CS:GO Team Database
Database contains data from esport teams game results. Application.properties doesn't contain username & password for security reasons.

## Test coverage
Tests cover all backend functions, addGame, fetchAllGames and deleteGame. Tests has been done without mocking.

## Ideas for develop
Currently database design is very simple with only one table. One develop route could be to expand database with Players-table which would contain all players and statistics.
